#  Team Profile Generator

My task is to take the given starter code and convert it into a working Node.js command-line application. This application will take in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person and the code passes each provided test.

## Instructions
The application has a number of features which include:
Accepting user inputs
When all the user inputs have been accepted then a completed team-page is rendered in the dist/ directory
When the GitHub username is clicked, their profile is opened up in a new tab
The default email program is opened when the email address of the employee is selected
All employees can have the following data input and rendered:
name
employee ID
email address
path to stored img of employee
Managers can have their office number input and rendered
Engineers can have their github username input and rendered


## Mock-Up

The following image shows a mock-up of the generated HTML’s appearance and functionality:
